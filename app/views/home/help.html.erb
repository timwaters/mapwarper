<h4>I'm having a problem</h4>
<p>See the GitHub for Issues, open and closed: <a href="https://github.com/timwaters/mapwarper/issues">https://github.com/timwaters/mapwarper/issues</a></p>
<br />
Common Problems:
<ul>
  <li>My PDF won't work: Mapwarper accepts images. PDFs are containers of stuff, they can contain text. Try to extract the image from the PDF and upload that</li>
  <li>My greyscale image won't work: Try to convert to RGB/Truecolor first and then upload. Often it seems as if images with just one or two bands cause issues</li>
  <li>The image from the URL doesn't work: Try downloading and uploading manually.</li>
  <li>How do I make a Mosaic from maps?: Add the maps to your favourites first </li>
  <li>How do I make a delete a map?: Go to the Edit tab of your map and find the delete link </li>
</ul>

<h4>Why can't I use google maps?</h4>
<p>This application is designed for use with the openstreetmap project.
  There are legal and ethical arguments not to use Google Maps when rectifiying
  and processing out of copyright maps. However, in my opinion you can use Google Satellite,
  so you may see a way to add this later.</p>
