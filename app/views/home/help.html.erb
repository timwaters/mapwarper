<h3>Help</h3>

<h4>I'm having a problem</h4>
<p>See the GitHub for Issues, open and closed: <a href="https://github.com/timwaters/mapwarper/issues">https://github.com/timwaters/mapwarper/issues</a></p>
<br />
Common Problems:
<ul>
  <li>My PDF won't work: Mapwarper accepts images. PDFs are containers of stuff, they can contain text. Try to extract the image from the PDF and upload that</li>
  <li>My greyscale image won't work: Try to convert to RGB/Truecolor first and then upload. Often it seems as if images with just one or two bands cause issues</li>
  <li>The image from the URL doesn't work: Try downloading and uploading manually.</li>
  <li>How do I make a Mosaic from maps: Add the maps to your favourites first </li>
</ul>

<h4>Why can't I use google maps?</h4>
<p>This application is designed for use with the openstreetmap project.
  There are legal and ethical arguments not to use Google Maps when rectifiying
  and processing out of copyright maps. However, in my opinion you can use Google Satellite,
  so you may see a way to add this later.</p>

<h4>Can I get the code and help?</h4>
<p>Yes. you can get the code here: <a href="http://github.com/timwaters/mapwarper/">http://github.com/timwaters/mapwarper/</a> it's currently MIT licenced<br />
  . You can contact me, Tim Waters, by mail at tim@geothings.net</p>

<h4>What are the terms for uploading maps?</h4>
<p>By uploading images to the website you agree that you allow anyone to view and use them,
  including changing control points. <br />
  So we recommend that you have permission to upload them.
  Uploading and making images available does not grant a copyright license to others.
  There is no guarantee about privacy or protection of images and metadata uploaded
  (see note below about personal data).<br />
  If you suspect a copyright infringement, please mail tim@geothings.net.
  <br />Generally, make sure the image is free to distribute or copy - and please make a note in the
  description if there
  are any special conditions.<br />

<h4>Is there a privacy policy?</h4>
<p>We hate spam - your personal data (used for logging in etc) will be kept private,
  and they will never be shared with any third party, and will only be used in the rare occasion
  if we need to contact you.
  <br />If you want your details deleted, please mail tim@geothings.net </p>
