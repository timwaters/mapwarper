README 
--------

Some things you may need to set up first:

libgdal-ruby is used to get the raster extents to update the bounding box of a warped map

config/deploy.rb for capistrano users, change this as fits. Have a look and see
 how it works with shared paths, to save mapserver map files and images between deploys.

gdal - needs to be installed, again FWTOOLS good. the path to the gdal executable
 directory can be added / changed in config/environments/production.rb and/or development.rb if
It cannot find it on the PATH.

libmapscript-ruby also needed.

Versions - from ubuntuGIS
libmapscript-ruby version 5.6.6-2~lucid1
gdal-bin version 1.7.3-2~lucid1

Some files you will need to put manually there, and capistrano copies across to the correct place, basically enables
the code not to have site specific stuff in svn.

config/initializers/session_store.rb.example into shared/config/session_store.rb
config/initializers/mail.rb. put mail.rb into shared/config folder
config/environments/production.rb again, into shared/config folder
config/database.yml.production into shared/config folder
see deploy.rb for details

create folders shared/system/mapimages/src and /dst and /dst/png


database - standard rails db migrate should do the trick - mysql or sqlite3 should
make sure you login as the admin set up in the migration 010 and use this to create a new user, and use this to disable this initial default admin

be fine. Change the database.example file to your database.yml 

imagemagick required for paperclip and thumbnail handling....

legacy import from older warper with mapscans
you can use the custom rake command
RAILS_ENV=development rake legacy:migrate --trace
---------
replace GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY in production.rb to your own


Other optional config options put in you environment files
MAX_DIMENSION =  2000  #max dimension width or height for an upload. Otherwise it will get resized to fit this max size
MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE = 5.megabyte #max upload file size
GDAL_MEMORY_LIMIT = 20 # max memory used for gdal_warp, may keep some servers sweet
if you comment these out, then no constraints are used
