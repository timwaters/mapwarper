<h4>Why doesn't it work?</h4>
<p>It's like proto-alpha, so things will break, go missing or just plain not work.
But they should work, so drop us a line at tim@geothings.net and I'll take a look</p>

<h4>Why can't I use google maps?</h4>
<p>This application is designed for use with the openstreetmap project.
There are legal and ethical arguments not to use Google Maps when rectifiying
and processing out of copyright maps. However, in my opinion you can use Google Satellite, so you may see a way to add this
later.</p>

<h4>WMS & JOSM</h4>

<p>Grab the wms link and paste that into the relevant place using the wmsplugin.
Have a look on the openstreetmap wiki for more info.</p>

<h4>Can I get the code and help?</h4>
<p>Yes. you can get the code here: http://svn2.geothings.net/mapwarper/ it's currently MIT licenced<br />
. You can contact me, Tim Waters, by mail at tim@geothings.net</p>

<h4>What are the terms for uploading maps?</h4>
<p>By uploading images to the website you agree that you allow anyone to view and use them,
including changing control points etc. <br />
So we recommend that you have permission to upload them.
Uploading and making images available does not grant a copyright license to others.
There is no guarantee about privacy or protection of images and metadata uploaded (see note below about personal data).<br />
If you suspect a copyright infringement, please mail tim@geothings.net.
<br />Generally, make sure the image is free to distribute or copy - and please make a note in the description if there
are any special condtions.<br />
Soon, users will be able to make maps private.<br />

</p>

<h4>Is there a privacy policy?</h4>
<p>We hate spam - your personal data (used for logging in etc) will be kept private,
and they will never be shared with any third party, and will only be used in the rare occasion if we need to contact you.
<br />If you want your details deleted, please mail tim@geothings.net </p>
